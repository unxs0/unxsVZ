# Export using DNSXML

## dnsxml - A standard XML representation of DNS data
[draft-daley-dnsxml-00](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-daley-dnsxml-00.html)

### Proposed functionality
Given a unxsBind NS set we generate a text document as per the above draft standard.

### Notes
When validating use schema with regex reassmebled. Have supplied validation.xml for this.
