Hi...release early, often...in this case very early.

Prerequisites
-------------
mySQL server and client libs installed and running on same server as the application.
You must know the root password. (Paranoids: Check the install script in mainfunc.h)

Must have a running Apache server on the same server with cgi capabilities.
Should be SSL enabled if possible (see below for intranet or other just "testing"
non-SSL setup)

FreeRADIUS Server Installation
---------------------------------
Just run the installradius.sh shell script at this directory and you are done :)

Example BASH Install Instructions
---------------------------------
shell>tar xzf mysqlRadius2N.M.tar.gz
shell>cd mysqlRadius2
shell>export CGIDIR=/apache/cgi-bin/ (or whatever your Apache cgi-bin dir is)
shell>vi local.h
	Edit to taste
shell>vi makefile
	Edit to taste
shell>make
	Make sure everything is ok. Fix anything broken.
shell>make install
shell>export ISMROOT=/home/joe
	Or whatever dir the mysql application project dir is in.
shell>/cgi-bin/mysqlRadius2.cgi Initialize <your mysql password for root>
	This will setup application and allow you to login as user "Root" password "wsxedc".
	Change the passwd asap for real world applications.

CSS Images
----------
Your apache htdocs dir must have an images directory and you must copy all
the main.c StyleSheet() images there.

SSL Only Setup
-------------
If you have an SSL server handy edit local.h and comment out:
//#define SSLONLY
like so...
#define SSLONLY
Then
shell>rm *.o
shell>make

Read More
---------
cp docs/tutorial.html to a browser accesible place or sym link to it if possible.
Read it!

Standard OpenISP setup backup operations
----------------------------------------
(Loose instructions adjust to fit for your particular setup)
shell>useradd -d openisp
shell>mkdir -p ~openisp/mysqlRadius2/data
shell>chown mysql ~openisp/mysqlRadius2/data
shell>crontab -e
Adding the following: Where mysqlpasswd is replaced by YOUR real mysql root passwd.

#
#mysqlRadius2
#
##backup
20 3 * * * ISMROOT=~openisp;export ISMROOT;/cgi-bin/mysqlRadius2.cgi Backup mysqlpasswd > /dev/null

Other backup ideas
------------------
You should probably cross server backup all your OpenISP module data like so. Note that this
involves using GRANT ALL mysql statements and a very secure internal ISP LAN. See mysql manual.
Think about ISP organization with edge servers with 2 NICs and an ISP admin firewall zone with
the mysql database server or replication cluster servers.

All servers should have internal mirror backup drives or other cheap fast and reliable backup
system (NFS and cpio in ISP admin firewall zone?)

shell>crontab -e
Add something like the following after setting up mysql for remote access from ONLY the IP in
question in a VERY secure LAN (non routable IP's...switched hubs...behind firewall...etc)

#Extra backup of mysqlRadius2 data only even days, using mysqldump from 192.168.100.23
20 4 * * */2 /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump -e -h 192.168.0.43 -u mysqlradius2 -pwsxedc --all {{cLCProject}} > ~openisp/mysqlRadius2/data/dumpall.txt

Loose your data and your fired
------------------------------
Don't be lazy backup and rebackup and database warehouse your mission critical data ALWAYS!
