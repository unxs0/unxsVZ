#	In 2.0.0, radrelay functionality is integrated into the
#	server core.  This virtual server gives an example of
#	using radrelay functionality inside of the server.
#
#	In this example, the detail file is read, and the data
#	is put into SQL.  This configuration is used when a RADIUS
#	server on this machine is receiving accounting packets,
#	and writing them to the detail file.
#
#	The purpose of this virtual server is to de-couple the storage
#	of long-term accounting data in SQL from "live" information
#	needed by the RADIUS server as it is running. 
#
#	The benefit of this approach is that for a busy server, the
#	overhead of performing SQL qeuries may be significant.  Also,
#	if the SQL databases are large (as is typical for ones storing
#	months of data), the INSERTs and UPDATEs may take a relatively
#	long time.  Rather than slowing down the RADIUS server by
#	having it interact with a database, you can just log the
#	packets to a detail file, and then read that file later at a
#	time when the RADIUS server is typically lightly loaded.
#
#	If you use on virtual server to log to the detail file,
#	and another virtual server (i.e. this one) to read from
#	the detail file, then this process will happen automatically.
#	A sudden spike of RADIUS traffic means that the detail file
#	will grow in size, and the server will be able to handle
#	large volumes of traffic quickly.  When the traffic dies down,
#	the server will have time to read the detail file, and insert
#	the data into a long-term SQL database.

		#
		#  The server can read accounting packets from the
		#  detail file much more quickly than those packets
		#  can be written to a database.  If the database is
		#  overloaded, then bad things can happen.
		#
		#  The server will keep track of how long it takes to
		#  process an entry from the detail file.  It will
		#  then pause between handling entries.  This pause
		#  allows databases to "catch up", and gives the
		#  server time to notice that other packets may have
		#  arrived.
		#		
		#  The pause is calculated dynamically, to ensure that
		#  the load due to reading the detail files is limited
		#  to a small percentage of CPU time.  The
		#  "load_factor" configuration item is a number
		#  between 1 and 100.  The server will try to keep the
		#  percentage of time taken by "detail" file entries
		#  to "load_factor" percentage of the CPU time.
		#
		#  If the "load_factor" is set to 100, then the server
		#  will read packets as fast as it can, usually
		#  causing databases to go into overload.
