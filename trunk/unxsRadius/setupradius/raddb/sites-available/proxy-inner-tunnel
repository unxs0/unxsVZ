server proxy-inner-tunnel {

#
#  This example is very simple.  All inner tunnel requests get
#  proxied to another RADIUS server.
#
authorize {
	#
	#  Do other things here, as necessary.
	#
	#  e.g. run the "realms" module, to decide how to proxy
	#  the inner tunnel request.
	#

	update control {
		#  You should update this to be one of your realms.
		Proxy-To-Realm := "example.com".
	}
}

#
#  Note that we do NOT have pre/post-proxy sections here.  For various
#  reasons, the pre/post-proxy stages are run in the context of the
#  OUTER tunnel session, and not the INNER tunnel session.
