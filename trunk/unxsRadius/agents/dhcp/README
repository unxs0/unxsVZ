In this directory we will develop an interface into unxsRadius data for the creation of a dynamic dhcpd
based on a dhcpd.conf file created with cLogin's of MAC format. Like those used in conjunction with unxsNAC.

Example of dhcpd.conf relevant section


class "High Priority User Cisco" {
	hardware ethernet 00:c0:c3:49:2b:57;//Thomas Hoell
	...more users
}

...more classes

subnet 10.0.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	pool {
		allow members of "High Priority User Cisco";
		range 10.0.10.3 10.0.10.254;
	}
}

...more subnets with class restrictions

Where "High Priority User Cisco" is a tProfileName.cLabel
Where tUser.cLogin is the MAC
Where tClient.cLabel is the client name via tUser.uClient
