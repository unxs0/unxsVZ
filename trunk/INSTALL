Hi...release early, often...in this case very early.

Prerequisites
-------------
mySQL server and client libs installed and running on same server as the application.
You must know the root password. (Paranoids: Check the install script in mainfunc.h)

Must have a running Apache server on the same server with cgi capabilities.
Should be SSL enabled if possible (see below for intranet or other just "testing"
non-SSL setup)


Example BASH Install Instructions
---------------------------------
shell>tar xzf unxsVZN.M.tar.gz
shell>cd unxsVZ
shell>export CGIDIR=/var/www/cgi-bin/ (or whatever your Apache cgi-bin dir is)
shell>vi local.h
	Edit to taste
shell>vi makefile
	Edit to taste
shell>make
	Make sure everything is ok. Fix anything broken.
shell>make install
shell>export ISMROOT=/home/joe
	Or whatever dir the mysql application project dir is in.
shell>/cgi-bin/unxsVZ.cgi Initialize <your mysql password for root>
	This will setup application and allow you to login as user "Root" password "wsxedc".
	Change the passwd asap for real world applications.

CSS Images
----------
Your apache htdocs dir must have an images directory and you must copy all
the main.c StyleSheet() images there.

SSL Only Setup
-------------
If you have an SSL server handy edit local.h and comment out:
//#define SSLONLY
like so...
#define SSLONLY
Then
shell>rm *.o
shell>make
