This directory will have test scripts that can be used to validate functionality
and be used for simple regression testing.

Initially sipsak will be used with test files. Some test files will
be used as the source of SIP traffic and others with the expected results
for simple diff result analysis.

Example text whole readable packet capture:

tcpdump -nnq -s 0 -A -vvv host 64.62.134.36 and port 5060
