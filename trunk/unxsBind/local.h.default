	//Use OPenLDAP client "ldapsearch" to determine the following settings:

	//Here is a hacked example where memberOf was set in a SN attr.
	//ex. ldapsearch -LLL -x -h 127.0.0.1  -D "cn=johndoe,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -w "123123" 
	//	-b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" "cn=johndoe" sn

	//dn: cn=johndoe,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
	//sn: Doe
	//sn: Doe-Jones
	//sn: memberOf=DNS ASP Company
	//
	//The cLDAPLINEPATTERN would be memberOf
	//The cLDAPPREFIXPATTERN would be memberOf=


	//This is the filter as specified in man ldapsearch
	#define cLDAPFILTER "(objectClass=*)"

	//as returned by ldapsearch. Must end with a "," or be the last value.
	#define cLDAPPREFIXPATTERN "memberOf="

	//Since the login usually is not LDAP BIND ready then
	//cLDAPLOGINPREFIX and cLDAPLOGINSUFFIX can be used.
	//Login format examples: 
	#define cLDAPLOGINPREFIX "cn="
	#define cLDAPLOGINSUFFIX ",ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
	//ex1: cn=johndoe,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com (DN)

	//#define cLDAPLOGINPREFIX "example.com\"
	//#define cLDAPLOGINSUFFIX ""
	//ex3: example.com\johndoe (Windows)

	//Org format: In case your LDAP data does not match what is configured in tClient.cLabel
	//then cLDAPORGPREFIX and cLDAPORGSUFFIX can be used. If not leave as empty strings "".
	#define	cLDAPORGPREFIX "The City of "
	#define	cLDAPORGSUFFIX ", California"
	//ex. For "...memberOf=Los Angeles,..." would translate into "The City of Los Angeles, California"
