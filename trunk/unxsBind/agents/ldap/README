In this directory we are developing C code to interface our legacy AA tClient and
tAuthorize system to an LDAP system with failover to a second LDAP server if the first
fails.

Initially we will run this as an agent to update tClient and tAuthorize. Future
systems should be able to replace tClient and tAuthorize entirely.

tConfiguration will be used to be able to translate enterprise specific LDAP
schema elements to what is needed to populate the Org/Contact/Role model
implemented by our tAuthorize and tClient.
