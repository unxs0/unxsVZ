The mysqlCluster agent checks via "show slave status" in script configurable mysql
servers. If any server shows that the replication functionality is off or behind,
a tLog entry is created on the local (socket) mysql server. And a standard
dashboard image in /var/www/unxs/html/images/mrcstatus.gif is changed from a
green to a red image.

Please read and test the mysqlcluster.sh script for more information.

To use:

<edit mysqlcluster.sh for your system and needs>
cd unxsBind/images
cp -i *.gif /var/www/unxs/html/images
crontab -e
<and add an entry for the mysqlcluster.sh script>

(binary rpm may have already installed the images)
