#PURPOSE
#	unxsBind 2.0 will feature fully automated DNSSEC 
#	signing, zone key roll-over and key management.
#	Here we are just playing around with basic elements,
#	and eventually hardware crypto interfaces.
#
#	For a single zone Gen all keys, sign zone and reload 
#	a master DNSSEC named for testing only.
