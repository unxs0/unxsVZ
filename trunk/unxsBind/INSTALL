Very quick CentOS 5 install guide
---------------------------------

Will provide a working system on your server for your
evaluation very quickly.

Single # is a command line operation
Double ## is a comment in command line operations

Does not cover setting installing a correct SSL cert, other servers,
editing your named.conf etc...etc...

Does not cover setting up boot init.d scripts for starting 
named, httpd and mysqld etc...

---
1-. Setup your /etc/yum.repos.d/ with the unxs.repo:

# wget http://unixservice.com/rpm/i386/unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm

## (optionally check md5sum of what you just downloaded)
# wget http://unixservice.com/rpm/i386/unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm.md5sum
# md5sum -c unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm.md5sum
## (if ok proceed to install rpm - we will not mention this check 
##	again but can be used for all our downloads.)

# rpm -i unxsyum-1.0-1.i386.rpm

Faster method? 
Optionally just create /etc/yum.repos.d/unxs.conf with this content:

[unxsVZ]
name=unxsVZ
baseurl=http://unixservice.com/rpm/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
md5check=1

---
2-. Use yum to install unxsbind and restart apache2:

# yum install unxsbind
# /etc/init.d/httpd restart

---
3-. Load initial data:

# export ISMROOT=/usr/local/share
# /var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/iDNS.cgi Initialize <your root mysql password>

---
4-. Start your BIND named daemon.

# /usr/sbin/named -c /usr/local/idns/named.conf
# rndc status

##(if the above did not work -should have been done by rpm, run this
##	and try the above again. Or run it to change the IP)
# export ISMROOT=/usr/local/share
# /var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/iDNS.cgi installbind 127.0.0.1

---
5-. Setup your root crontab

# crontab -e

Then place this in your crontab:

#
#iDNS job queue processing
#
#Dual master configuration
* * * * * /var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/iDNS.cgi ProcessJobQueue ns1.yourdomain.com >> /var/log/idns-cron.log 2>&1

#Place next line in root crontab for iDNS tHit subsystem
*/5 * * * * /usr/sbin/bind9-genstats.sh >> /var/log/idns-cron.log 2>&1


---
6-. Load idnsAdmin and idnsOrg templates:

---
7-. Test everything. If you find anything wrong in this guide,
