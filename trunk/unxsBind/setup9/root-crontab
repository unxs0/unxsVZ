# Cron jobs needed for unxsBind

# ------------------  EDIT THE CORRECT FILE  -------------------------
# This file is copied to /etc/cron.d/unxsbind from
# /usr/local/share/iDNS/setup/root-crontab when the unxsbind service 
# is started via its init.d script and the file /etc/cron.d/unxsbind is
# cleared when the service is stopped. Therefore any edits made
# directly to /etc/cron.d/unxsbind will be lost anytime the unxsbind 
# service restarts.
#
# To make changes, edit the master copy 
# /usr/local/share/iDNS/setup/root-crontab
#
# The reason this is done this way is because the unxsBind cron job
# should only be invoked if the unxsbind service is enabled and not
# just as a consequence of installing the unxsbind as it was the case
# previously.
