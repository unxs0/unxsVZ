More from wikipedia:\n<p>\nCNAME records are specified in RFC 1034. CNAMEs are handled specially in the\ndomain name system, and have several restrictions on their use. When a DNS\nresolver encounters a CNAME record while looking for a regular resource record,\nit will restart the query using the canonical name instead of the original name.\nWhen the resolver is told to look for CNAME records, the CNAME is returned,\nrather than restarting the query. The canonical name that a CNAME points to can\nbe anywhere in the DNS, whether local or on a remote server in a different DNS zone.\n\n<p>\nFor example, if there is a DNS zone as follows:\n\n<p>\n<pre>\nfoo.example.com.        CNAME  bar.example.com.\nbar.example.com.        A      192.0.2.23\n</pre>\n<p>\nWhen an A record lookup for foo.example.com is done, the resolver will see a\nCNAME record and restart the checking at bar.example.com and will then return\n192.0.2.23.\n<p>\nTerminology of CNAME vs \"canonical name\"\n<p>\nIt has been traditional to refer to the label of a CNAME record as \"a CNAME\".\nThis is unfortunate, as \"CNAME\" is an abbreviation of \"canonical name\", and the\nlabel of a CNAME record is most certainly not a canonical name. It is, however,\nan entrenched usage. Care must therefore be taken to be very clear whether the\nlabel, or the value (the canonical name) of a CNAME resource record is intended.\n(Quoting from RFC 2181 section 10.1.1)\n<p>\nSo, technically, a canonical name in the DNS is the primary name of a host (RFC\n1034 section 3.6.2.) created by something other than a CNAME, or DNAME record. A\nCNAME record creates an alias with a name on the left which points to a\ncanonical name specified on the right (the RDATA portion of the record).\n<p>\nRestrictions\n<p>\n1-. A CNAME must have no other resource records of other types (MX, A, etc.). (RFC\n1034 section 3.6.2, RFC 1912 section 2.4) The exception is when DNSSEC is being\nused, in which case there can be a DNSSEC related records such as RRSIG, NSEC,\netc. (RFC 2181 section 10.1)\n<p>\n2-. A CNAME records that point to other CNAME records should be avoided (RFC 1034\nsection 5.2.2). In particular, it is possible to create infinite loops with\nCNAME records, and other error conditions, as:\n<pre>\nfoo.example.com.	CNAME	bar.example.com.\nbar.example.com.	CNAME	foo.example.com.\n</pre>\n<p>\n3-. Other DNS record types, such as NS, MX, PTR, SRV, etc. that point to other names\nshould never point to a CNAME. (RFC 1034 section 3.6.2, RFC 1912 section 2.4)\nSo, for example, a zone should not contain constructs such as:\n<pre>\nfoo.example.com.	CNAME  host.example.com.\nhost.example.com.	A 	192.0.2.1\nexample.com.	MX	0	foo.example.com.\n</pre>\n<p>\n(In short CNAME RRs are complicated. Use only if you know what you are doing.)\n</dd>\n\n<dt>\n<strong>TXT</strong>\n</dt>\n<dd>\nThis record type allows you to associate any arbitrary text\nwith a host name. This may be used to define Domain Keys or SPF records.<br>\nE.g.:<br>\n<pre>\nmydomain.com.	TXT	\"v=spf1 ptr ~all\"\n</pre>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>\n<strong>PTR</strong>\n</dt>\n<dd>This resource type is only used when a reverse\n(in-addr.arpa) zone is selected. This record map a IPv4 address to a domain\nname.<br>\nE.g:<br>\n<pre>\n32	PTR	www.mydomain.com.<br>\n</pre>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>\n<strong>SRV</strong>\n</dt>\n<dd>\nThe RR is composed of:\n<p>\nA codified NAME with several components seperated by periods.\n<p>\n<strong>Service</strong>: The symbolic name of the desired service, that starts\nwith an underscore char (_).<br>\n<strong>Proto</strong>: The transport protocol of the desired service; this is\nusually either TCP\nor UDP, and as with the service starts with an underscore char (_).<br>\n<strong>Name</strong>: The domain name for which this record is valid.<br>\n<p>\nFour distinct paramters:\n<p>\n<strong>Priority</strong>: The priority of the target host, lower value means\nmore preferred.<br>\n<strong>Weight</strong>: A relative weight for records with the same priority.<br>\n<strong>Port</strong>: The TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found.<br>\n<strong>Target</strong>: The canonical hostname of the machine providing the\nservice.<br>\n<p>\nAn example SRV record might look like this:\n<pre>\n_sip._tcp.example.com.	SRV	0	5	5060	sipserver.example.com.\n</pre>\n</dd>\n\n<dt>\n<strong>AAAA</strong>\n</dt>\n<dd>\nIs a RR similar to the A RR. But with an IPv6 seven colon, with eight separated\nhex words\nformatted number.\n<p>\nLeading 0 suppression is automated in unxsBind, as well as\nconsecutive 0 hex segment compression. This keeps things readable and much\nsmaller, especially useful for improving DNSSEC encryption speed.\n<p>\nCompressed IPv6 example:\n<pre>\n2001:0db8:0234:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\nCan be compressed to:\n2001:db8:234::1\n</pre>\n<p>\nFor now we do not permit trailing :0000 since that is usually a network address.\nThis policy as well as the similar IPv4 one is being reviewed.\n</dd>\n\n<dt>\n<strong>NAPTR</strong>\n</dt>\n<dd>\nIs a special RR record mostly used for VOIP. More from wikipedia:\n<p>\nUniversal Resource Names (URNs) are a subset of Universal Resource Identifiers\n(URIs) used for abstract identitiers, such as a person\'s name or their telephone\nnumber. For URNs to be meaningful, they must be mapped to a concrete resource of\nsome sort. Universal Resource Locators (URLs) are often used to describe such\nresources, such as a computer hostname, or a local file.\n<p>\nAs part of the standardization of URNs, NAPTR records were introduced to do just\nthis. NAPTR records map between sets of URNs, URLs and plain domain names and\nsuggest to clients what protocol should be used to talk to the mapped resource.\nEach NAPTR record contains a service name, a set of flags, a regexp rule, an\norder value, a preference and a replacement. Multiple records can be chained\ntogether in a cascade to rewrite URIs in fairly sophisticated, but deterministic\nways. These cascading rules have been standardized in RFC2915 and RFC3403.\n<p>\nA common use for NAPTR records is in SIP, where it is used to route phone calls\nover the Internet. For example, the SIP URN for the US telephone number\n1-800-555-1234 would be tel:+1-800-555-1234 and its domain name\n4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa. A SIP client doing a lookup on that name might\nreceive:\n<p>\n<pre>\n$ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa.\nIN NAPTR 100 10 \"U\" \"E2U+sip\" \"!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!i\" .\nIN NAPTR 102 10 \"U\" \"E2U+email\" \"!^.*$!mailto:information@x.com!i\" .\n</pre>\n<p>\nThe first record has an order value of 100, which is lower than 102, so it is\npicked first. Its preference of 10 is unimportant as there are no other rules\nwith order 100. The service name E2U+sip is an ENUM string indicating that the\nrecord can be used in phone number-to-SIP lookups. The client then goes on to\napply the regexp rule !^.*$!sip:service@x.com!, which replaces\nits entire lookup URN tel:+1-800-555-1234 with sip:service@x.com.\nThe \"U\" flag indicates that the replacement string is a SIP URN, and that no\nfurther rules should be applied.\n<p>\nTo resolve SIP URN, the client then performs a second NAPTR lookupâ€”on\nx.com, yielding:\n<p>\n<pre>\n$ORIGIN x.com.\nNAPTR 100 10 \"S\" \"SIP+D2U\" \"!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!\" _sip._udp.x.com\nNAPTR 102 10 \"S\" \"SIP+D2T\" \"!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!\" _sip._tcp.x.com\n</pre>\nAs before, the client picks the first record because it has the lowest order\nvalue. The regexp rule replaces the lookup URN, this time with the domain name\n_sip._udp.x.com. The \"S\" flag indicates that resulting domain name points\nto a SRV record. The client thus finishes with _sip._udp.x.com, for which\nit can then fetch a SRV record to initiate a VOIP call.\n</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n\n\n\n'),(12,'IP Number',1,1,1175710444,0,0,'A dot separated number that identifies uniquely a host<br>\n<br>\nE.g.:<br>\n<br>\n217.15.45.7\n'),(13,'Preference Number',1,1,1175710642,1,1175710689,'The Preference Number of a mail server indicates the priority of the server in\nthe mail server list for receiving email messages.<br>\nThe lower the number, the higher the priority.<br>\n<br>\nE.g.:<br>\n<br>\n<pre>\nmydomain.com IN MX 10 mail1.mydomain.com.\n                         IN MX 20 mail2.mydomain.com.\n                         IN MX 30 mail3.mydomain.com.\n</pre>\n'),(14,'Mail Server',1,1,1175713870,0,0,'The FQDN of the mail server that will hande the incoming email for a domain.<br>\nPlease note the final dot:<br>\nE.g.:<br>\nmydomain.com 10 MX mail1.mydomain.com.<br>'),(15,'Operating System',1,1,1175713968,0,0,'The Operating System of the host referenced by the Resource Name.

See our tZone.uZoneTTL\n\nRFC 1912 recommends that the $TTL value be set to 1 day or longer and that\ncertain RRs which rarely change, such as the MX records for the domain, use an\nexplicit TTL value to set even longer values such as 2 to 3 weeks. The value of\nthis field is a balance between how frequently you think the DNS records will\nchange vs load on the DNS server. In the example below the $TTL value of 2d (2\ndays) indicates that any change may not be fully propagated for 48 hours,\nequally caching DNS servers will require to re-read the RRs from your DNS every\n48 hours which can be a non-trivial load.

Flags are single characters from\nthe set [A-Z0-9].  The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant. <br>\n At this time only four flags, \"S\", \"A\", \"U\", and \"P\", are defined.  The \"S\",\n\"A\" and \"U\" flags denote a terminal lookup. This means that this NAPTR record is\nthe last one and that the flag determines what the next stage should be.  The\n\"S\" flag means that the next lookup should be for SRV records.  \"A\" means that\nthe next lookup should be for either an A, AAAA, or A6 record.  The \"U\" flag\nmeans that the next step is not a DNS lookup but that the output of the Regexp\nfield is an URI that adheres to the \'absoluteURI\' production found in the ABNF\nof RFC 2396. <br>\n\n'),(297,'Regex ( optional SRV)',1,1,1268307314,1,1270760713,'Regex:<br>\nA STRING containing a substitution expression that is applied to the original\nstring held by the client in order to construct the next domain name to lookup.<br>\n<br>\nOptional SRV:<br>\nThe next NAME to query for NAPTR, SRV, or address records depending on the value\nof the flags field.

This option may be useful if you want to publish a zone to a\nset of NSs, but with only tResource provided NS RRs.\n\n//DotSignedExtension\n\nThis directs unxsBind to use the zone name with a .signed extension. This is\nused internally for testing initial DNSSEC support.\n\n//TypeForward ForwardOnly Forwarders={10.240.0.1;10.240.0.2;};\n\nThis directs unxsBind to create a type forward zone. You must also specify \n\nForwardOnly \n\nor\n\nForwardFirst\n\nYou must end the option with the Forwarders= list in BIND format. I.e.\n\n{IPv4-1;IPv4-2;...;}; \n\nWhere you must use at least one IPv4.\n\n---\n\nTSIG Notes\n\nIf a tConfiguration cTSIGKeyName global TSIG key name value exists. It is placed\nin the master.zones zone section like so for EVERY ZONE:\n\nallow-transfer { key cTSIGKeyName;};\nallow-update { key cTSIGKeyName;};\n\nIf you only want some zones to have these BIND statements (or every zone to use\na different key name. You can set that directly in cOptions for each zone.');
