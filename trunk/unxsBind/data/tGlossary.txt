Phone: 555-0565<br>\
Fax: 555-0566\

2	Serial Number	1	1	1173480218	0	0	The serial number format is YYYYMMDDNN, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month,\
DD is the day, and NN is a count of how many times the zone data was modified\
that day. <br>These fields won't work in any other order, since no other order\
gives a value that always increases as the date changes. <br>This is critical:\
whatever format you choose, it's important that the serial number always\
increase when you update your zone data.
3	Expire TTL	1	1	1173480447	0	0	Used by other DNS servers that are configured to load and host the zone to\
determine when zone data expires if it is not renewed.\

4	Refresh TTL	1	1	1173480497	0	0	Used to determine how often other DNS servers that load and host the zone must\
attempt to renew the zone.
5	Retry TTL	1	1	1173480526	0	0	Used to determine how often other DNS servers that load and host the zone are to\
retry a request for update of the zone each time that the refresh interval occurs.
6	Default TTL	1	1	1173480628	0	0	This TTL will be used as default for all the Resource Records that do not have\
an explicit TTL set (i.e TTL = 0)\

7	Negative TTL	1	1	1173480838	0	0	 Negative caching TTL Negative answers (such as when a requested record does not\
exist) can be cached on non-authoritative servers as well. This field acts like\
the overall TTL but specifically for negative answers. Small values are\
appropriate (15m to 2h). 
8	Hostmaster	1	1	1173481017	0	0	Email address of the person responsible for the zone. Please note that the '@'\
symbol has to be changed by a '.'.<br>\
<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<br>\
joe@someisp.net<br>\
<br>\
turns into:<br>\
<br>\
joe.someisp.net\

9	Resource TTL	1	1	1173482563	1	1175623776	The time the Resource Record will be cached in seconds. If left blank, (0) it\
will use the default TTL for the Zone.\

10	Resource Name	1	1	1175623565	1	1175623677	Indicates the name of the RR. Based on the RR Type this may have a different\
meaning:<br>\
<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<br>\
In a 'A' type RR, Resource Name indicates the host:<br>\
<br>\
www IN A 217.32.45.123<br>\
<br>\
Resource Name: www<br>\
RR Type: A<br>\
IP Address: 217.32.45.123<br>\
<br>\
Please note that is also possible to leave Resource Name blank for A records, in\
that case it takes the value of the $ORIGIN (The zone name)
11	Resource Type	1	1	1175625855	1	1270850765	Indicates the type of the resource record (RR).<br>\
<p>\
RR type may be one of the following:\
\
<dl>\
<dt>\
<strong>A</strong>\
</dt> \
<dd>\
This RR maps a hostname to a 32-bit IPv4 address.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<pre>\
www\	A\	217.136.12.45<br>\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
\
<dt>\
<strong>MX</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
 Is a RR type that specifys how Internet e-mail\
should be routed. MX records point to the servers that should receive an e-mail,\
and their priority relative to each other.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<pre>\
mydomain.com\	MX\	10\	mailserver.mydomain.com.\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>HINFO</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
 A host Information RR can be set up to give\
hardware operating system (OS) information about each host. Its presence is\
optional, but having the information available can be useful.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<pre>\
myserver\	HINFO\	"Pentium III"\	"Linux"\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>CNAME</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
This record type is used to define an alias host name. More from wikipedia:\
<p>\
CNAME records are specified in RFC 1034. CNAMEs are handled specially in the\
domain name system, and have several restrictions on their use. When a DNS\
resolver encounters a CNAME record while looking for a regular resource record,\
it will restart the query using the canonical name instead of the original name.\
When the resolver is told to look for CNAME records, the CNAME is returned,\
rather than restarting the query. The canonical name that a CNAME points to can\
be anywhere in the DNS, whether local or on a remote server in a different DNS zone.\
\
<p>\
For example, if there is a DNS zone as follows:\
\
<p>\
<pre>\
foo.example.com.        CNAME  bar.example.com.\
bar.example.com.        A      192.0.2.23\
</pre>\
<p>\
When an A record lookup for foo.example.com is done, the resolver will see a\
CNAME record and restart the checking at bar.example.com and will then return\
192.0.2.23.\
<p>\
Terminology of CNAME vs "canonical name"\
<p>\
It has been traditional to refer to the label of a CNAME record as "a CNAME".\
This is unfortunate, as "CNAME" is an abbreviation of "canonical name", and the\
label of a CNAME record is most certainly not a canonical name. It is, however,\
an entrenched usage. Care must therefore be taken to be very clear whether the\
label, or the value (the canonical name) of a CNAME resource record is intended.\
(Quoting from RFC 2181 section 10.1.1)\
<p>\
So, technically, a canonical name in the DNS is the primary name of a host (RFC\
1034 section 3.6.2.) created by something other than a CNAME, or DNAME record. A\
CNAME record creates an alias with a name on the left which points to a\
canonical name specified on the right (the RDATA portion of the record).\
<p>\
Restrictions\
<p>\
1-. A CNAME must have no other resource records of other types (MX, A, etc.). (RFC\
1034 section 3.6.2, RFC 1912 section 2.4) The exception is when DNSSEC is being\
used, in which case there can be a DNSSEC related records such as RRSIG, NSEC,\
etc. (RFC 2181 section 10.1)\
<p>\
2-. A CNAME records that point to other CNAME records should be avoided (RFC 1034\
section 5.2.2). In particular, it is possible to create infinite loops with\
CNAME records, and other error conditions, as:\
<pre>\
foo.example.com.\	CNAME\	bar.example.com.\
bar.example.com.\	CNAME\	foo.example.com.\
</pre>\
<p>\
3-. Other DNS record types, such as NS, MX, PTR, SRV, etc. that point to other names\
should never point to a CNAME. (RFC 1034 section 3.6.2, RFC 1912 section 2.4)\
So, for example, a zone should not contain constructs such as:\
<pre>\
foo.example.com.\	CNAME  host.example.com.\
host.example.com.\	A \	192.0.2.1\
example.com.\	MX\	0\	foo.example.com.\
</pre>\
<p>\
(In short CNAME RRs are complicated. Use only if you know what you are doing.)\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>TXT</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
This record type allows you to associate any arbitrary text\
with a host name. This may be used to define Domain Keys or SPF records.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<pre>\
mydomain.com.\	TXT\	"v=spf1 ptr ~all"\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>PTR</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>This resource type is only used when a reverse\
(in-addr.arpa) zone is selected. This record map a IPv4 address to a domain\
name.<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<pre>\
32\	PTR\	www.mydomain.com.<br>\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>SRV</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
The RR is composed of:\
<p>\
A codified NAME with several components seperated by periods.\
<p>\
<strong>Service</strong>: The symbolic name of the desired service, that starts\
with an underscore char (_).<br>\
<strong>Proto</strong>: The transport protocol of the desired service; this is\
usually either TCP\
or UDP, and as with the service starts with an underscore char (_).<br>\
<strong>Name</strong>: The domain name for which this record is valid.<br>\
<p>\
Four distinct paramters:\
<p>\
<strong>Priority</strong>: The priority of the target host, lower value means\
more preferred.<br>\
<strong>Weight</strong>: A relative weight for records with the same priority.<br>\
<strong>Port</strong>: The TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found.<br>\
<strong>Target</strong>: The canonical hostname of the machine providing the\
service.<br>\
<p>\
An example SRV record might look like this:\
<pre>\
_sip._tcp.example.com.\	SRV\	0\	5\	5060\	sipserver.example.com.\
</pre>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>AAAA</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
Is a RR similar to the A RR. But with an IPv6 seven colon, with eight separated\
hex words\
formatted number.\
<p>\
Leading 0 suppression is automated in unxsBind, as well as\
consecutive 0 hex segment compression. This keeps things readable and much\
smaller, especially useful for improving DNSSEC encryption speed.\
<p>\
Compressed IPv6 example:\
<pre>\
2001:0db8:0234:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\
Can be compressed to:\
2001:db8:234::1\
</pre>\
<p>\
For now we do not permit trailing :0000 since that is usually a network address.\
This policy as well as the similar IPv4 one is being reviewed.\
</dd>\
\
<dt>\
<strong>NAPTR</strong>\
</dt>\
<dd>\
Is a special RR record mostly used for VOIP. More from wikipedia:\
<p>\
Universal Resource Names (URNs) are a subset of Universal Resource Identifiers\
(URIs) used for abstract identitiers, such as a person's name or their telephone\
number. For URNs to be meaningful, they must be mapped to a concrete resource of\
some sort. Universal Resource Locators (URLs) are often used to describe such\
resources, such as a computer hostname, or a local file.\
<p>\
As part of the standardization of URNs, NAPTR records were introduced to do just\
this. NAPTR records map between sets of URNs, URLs and plain domain names and\
suggest to clients what protocol should be used to talk to the mapped resource.\
Each NAPTR record contains a service name, a set of flags, a regexp rule, an\
order value, a preference and a replacement. Multiple records can be chained\
together in a cascade to rewrite URIs in fairly sophisticated, but deterministic\
ways. These cascading rules have been standardized in RFC2915 and RFC3403.\
<p>\
A common use for NAPTR records is in SIP, where it is used to route phone calls\
over the Internet. For example, the SIP URN for the US telephone number\
1-800-555-1234 would be tel:+1-800-555-1234 and its domain name\
4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa. A SIP client doing a lookup on that name might\
receive:\
<p>\
<pre>\
$ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa.\
IN NAPTR 100 10 "U" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!i" .\
IN NAPTR 102 10 "U" "E2U+email" "!^.*$!mailto:information@x.com!i" .\
</pre>\
<p>\
The first record has an order value of 100, which is lower than 102, so it is\
picked first. Its preference of 10 is unimportant as there are no other rules\
with order 100. The service name E2U+sip is an ENUM string indicating that the\
record can be used in phone number-to-SIP lookups. The client then goes on to\
apply the regexp rule !^.*$!sip:service@x.com!, which replaces\
its entire lookup URN tel:+1-800-555-1234 with sip:service@x.com.\
The "U" flag indicates that the replacement string is a SIP URN, and that no\
further rules should be applied.\
<p>\
To resolve SIP URN, the client then performs a second NAPTR lookup—on\
x.com, yielding:\
<p>\
<pre>\
$ORIGIN x.com.\
NAPTR 100 10 "S" "SIP+D2U" "!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!" _sip._udp.x.com\
NAPTR 102 10 "S" "SIP+D2T" "!^.*$!sip:service@x.com!" _sip._tcp.x.com\
</pre>\
As before, the client picks the first record because it has the lowest order\
value. The regexp rule replaces the lookup URN, this time with the domain name\
_sip._udp.x.com. The "S" flag indicates that resulting domain name points\
to a SRV record. The client thus finishes with _sip._udp.x.com, for which\
it can then fetch a SRV record to initiate a VOIP call.\

#
51	uTTL	1	1	1208792866	1	1208793186	The $TTL directive is defined in RFC 2308.\
\
TTL in the DNS context defines the duration in seconds that the record may be\
cached. Zero indicates the record should not be cached. Note: RFC 1912 cautions\
that 0 = no caching is not widely implemented so make no assumptions.\
\
The default TTL for the zone is defined in BIND9 by the $TTL directive which\
must appear at the beginning of the zone file i.e. before any RR to which it\
will apply. This $TTL is used for any Resource Record which does not explicitly\
set the 'ttl' field.\
\
The TTL field is defined to be an unsigned 32 bit value with a valid range from\
0 to 2147483647 (clarified in RFC 2181) - which is a long time! - somewhere on\
the other side of 68 years.\
\
The $TTL field may take any time value.\
\
In BIND 8 the SOA record (minimum parameter) was used to define the zone default\
TTL value. In BIND 9 the SOA 'minimum' parameter is used as the negative\
(NXDOMAIN) caching time (defined in RFC 2308). See our tZone.uZoneTTL\
\
RFC 1912 recommends that the $TTL value be set to 1 day or longer and that\
certain RRs which rarely change, such as the MX records for the domain, use an\
explicit TTL value to set even longer values such as 2 to 3 weeks. The value of\
this field is a balance between how frequently you think the DNS records will\
change vs load on the DNS server. In the example below the $TTL value of 2d (2\
days) indicates that any change may not be fully propagated for 48 hours,\
equally caching DNS servers will require to re-read the RRs from your DNS every\
48 hours which can be a non-trivial load. Many users will set this value to say\
2w (2 weeks) in normal operation then prior to planned changes will reduce the\
value to say 1d or 12h, until the change has stabilized then restore the value\
to 2w.
52	uZoneTTL	1	1	1208793324	0	0	uZoneTTL is the last TTL SOA value, the minumum parameter as explained below:\
\
In BIND 9 the SOA 'minimum' parameter is used as the negative\
(NXDOMAIN) caching time (defined in RFC 2308).\
\
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse with uTTL which is the $TTL directive value. See uTTL.
53	uZone	1	1	1208795481	0	0	uZone is the internal SQL database unsigned integer key assigned to a single\
tZone record.
54	cZone	1	1	1208795597	1	1208796021	cZone is the name of a fully qualified DNS zone (with no trailing dot.) There\
can be multiple tZone records with the same cZone as long as they are for\
different views (see tView.)\
\
IMPORTANT\
\
You have to be careful to understand the node/level hierarchy in DNS so that if\
you have in your DNS configuration, for example, two zone files where one is\
included in the other the most specific will in most cases overwrite the\
resource record  and SOA data of the less specific.\
\
An example: \
\
biginternet.com and www.biginternet.com are both setup in your DNS system\
(arguably not a best practice!) Then even if an A record for www exists in the\
biginternet.com zone. It would not be served. The A record if it exists in\
www.biginternet.com would be served, and if the A record does not exist in\
www.biginternet.com then a nxdomain would be served. In general the less\
specific zone will be ignored if a more specific match exists. \
\
These cases cause great confusion among new DNS administrators.\
\

55	uNameServer	1	1	1208797747	0	0	uNameServer is the unsigned integer key into tNameServer.\
\
The table tNameServer is where sets of name servers (NSs) are configured.\
\
From the tZone tab you can assign or change any pre-configured name server set\
(NS set)  for a given tZone. \
\
Please note the possible problems that may arise if you assign different NS sets\
to same tZone.cZone but with different views.\
\
In general a seconday only zone will have a special NS set created, and have an\
external  master configured. This is a master DNS server setup to transfer to\
the herein slave servers authoratative data according to the SOA TTLs.
56	cHostmaster	1	1	1208797992	0	0	cHostmaster is the email for person (or a role) responsible for this zone. \
\
It does NOT USE NORMAL EMAIL NOTATION. But uses the DNS . (dot) instead of the @\
symbol. This means that the email can not have a dot before the email domain.\
For example john.smith@biginternet.com would become in DNS parlance:\
john@smith.biginternet.com.
57	uSerial	1	1	1208798119	0	0	uSerial is an unsigned 32 bit value in range 1 to 4294967295 with a maximum\
increment of 2147483647. In BIND implementations this is defined to be a 10\
digit field. \
\
This value MUST change when any resource record in the zone file is updated. The\
convention is to use a date based value to simplify this task - the most popular\
being yyyymmddss where yyyy = year, mm = month and dd = day ss = a sequence\
number in case you update it more than once in the day! Using this date format\
means that the value 2005021002 means the last update was on the 10th Febrary\
2005 and it was the third update that day. \
\
The date format is just a convention not a requirement so BIND will provide no\
validation of the field. It is easy to make mistakes and get serial numbers out\
of sequence. That is why mysqlBind2 takes care of this for you.
58	uExpire	1	1	1208798255	0	0	uExpire is a signed 32 bit value in seconds. It indicates when the zone data is\
no longer authoritative. This applies to slaves or secondary servers only.\
Slaves stop responding to queries for the zone when this time has expired and no\
contact has been made with the master. \
\
Thus when the ref values expires the slave will attempt to read the SOA record\
for the zone - and request a zone transfer AXFR/IXFR if the sn has changed. If\
contact is made the expiry and refresh values are reset and tyhe cycle starts\
again. \
\
If the slave fails to contact the master it will retry every retry period but\
continue to supply authoritative data for the zone until the expiry value is\
reached at which point it will stop answering queries for the domain. RFC 1912\
recommends 1209600 to 2419200 seconds (2-4 weeks) to allow for major outages of\
the master.
59	uRefresh	1	1	1208798378	0	0	uRefresh is an usigned 32 bit time value in seconds (in mysqlBind.) \
\
It indicates the time when the slave will try to refresh the zone from the master. \
\
RFC 1912 recommends 1200 to 43200 seconds, low (1200) if the data is volatile or\
43200 (12 hours) if it's not. Since mysqlBind clusters are using NOTIFY you can\
set for much higher values e.g. 1 or more days > 86400.
60	uRetry	1	1	1208798568	0	0	uRetry is an unsigned 32 bit value in seconds. \
\
It defines the time between retries if the slave (secondary) fails to contact\
the master when uRefresh has expired. \
\
Typical values would be 180 (3 minutes) to 900 (15 minutes) or higher.

_http._tcp.example.com.<br>\
<br>\
We can divide this field in three parts:<br>\
<li>Service</li>\
<li>Protocol</li>\
<li>Name</li>\
<br>\
\
<b>Service:</b><br>\
\
Defines the symbolic service name (see  <a\
href=http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers target=_blank\
class=darkLink>IANA port-numbers</a>) prepended with a '_' (underscore). Case\
insensitive. Common values are:\

\
<b>Name:</b><br>\
\
Must be the zone FQDN ending with a dot.\
\

201	Priority	1	1	1259875422	0	0	The relative priority of this service (range 0 - 65535). Lowest is highest\
priority, usage is the same as the MX preference field.\
\

211	Weight	1	1	1259875469	0	0	Used when more than one service has the same priority. An integer in the range 0\
- 65535. The value 0 indicates no weighting should be applied. If the weight is\
1 or greater it is a relative number in which the highest is most frequently\
delivered, that is, given two SRV records both with Priority = 0, one with\
weight = 1 the other weight = 6, the one with weight 6 will have its RR\
delivered first 6 times out of 7 by the name server.
221	Port	1	1	1259875525	0	0	Normally the port number assigned to the symbolic service but this is not a\
requirement, for instance, it is permissible to define a _http service with a\
port number of 8100 rather than the more normal port 80.\

231	Target	1	1	1259875556	0	0	The name of the host that will provide this service. Does not have to be in the\
same zone (domain). May be just a host name or a FQDN.
241	IP Block	1	1	1259877668	0	0	Enter the IP block in either CIDR (192.168.0.1/24) or dash (192.168.0.1-255)\

block one below the other. E.g:<br>\
<br>\
ns1.unixservice.com.<br>\
ns2.unixservice.com.<br>\
<br>\
Don't forget the final dot.
261	TTL	1	1	1259878227	0	0	Use this field if you want to specify a different TTL for the delegation RRs, if\
not specified or 0, the zone default TTL will be used.\

271	IP Format	1	1	1259878397	0	0	Select the format of the data that you will enter at the right panel. Currently\
the only supported format is RIPE. ARIN and LACNIC format support is coming soon.\

281	IP Auth Tab Details	1	1	1259878499	4	1259878511	At this tab you can import IP authority data into your iDNS database.<br>\
With the IP authority data you'll setup blocks and companies. If a block and/or\
company is not mentioned in the data you enter at the right panel <font\
color=red>they will be removed from the database</font> and the operation has no\
undo.<br>\
If a block changes ownership,  the RRs belonging to it will be reset to default\
RRs.<br>\
If a block is expanded new RRs will be created as required (with default PTR.)<br>\
When a new company is created, a default contact with the name of the company\
and a a random password will be also created.<br>\
Don't forget to place a CSV file with company names and ids at\
/usr/local/idns/csv/companies.csv<br>\
Also you must make sure that there's a tConfiguration entry uDefaultClient with\
your ASP tClient row id.\
\

291	IP Auth Data	1	1	1259878579	0	0	At this textarea you enter the data to import into the iDNS database. Lines\

292	IPv6 Number	1	1	1268297008	1	1268297091	This next generation of the Internet Protocol, aimed to replace IPv4 on the\
Internet, was eventually named Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) in 1995[3][4]\
The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bits or 16 octets, which, even\
with a generous assignment of network blocks, is deemed sufficient for the\
foreseeable future. <br>\
<br>\

<br>\
<br>\
Example of an IPv6 address:<br>\
<br>\
2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334\
\

293	e164.arpa Origin or FQDN	1	1	1268297337	1	1268654839	@ or FQDN zone name.\
<p>\
If the zone is a e164.arpa then the following may apply:\
<p>\
The ITU ENUM allocates a specific zone, namely "e164.arpa" for use with ENUM\
E.164 numbers on the IP side of the network. <a\
href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3761 class=darkLink target=_blank>RFC\
3761</a> define how any ENUM number, such as +1 555 42 42 can be transformed\
into a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), by reversing the numbers, separating\
them with dots and adding the e164.arpa suffix thus:<br>\
2.4.2.4.5.5.5.1.e164.arpa<br>\
<br>\
The URI can then be used to obtain the Internet Protocol addresses for services\
such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) VoIP telephony. In the Domain Name\
System, NAPTR records are used to set the subscriber call forwarding/termination\
preferences. Therefore the whole system can 'translate' E.164 addresses to SIP\
addresses.<br>\
\

294	Order	1	1	1268299458	1	1268301510	An unsigned integer specifying the order in which the NAPTR records MUST be\
processed to ensure the correct ordering of rules.  Low numbers are processed\
before high numbers, and once a NAPTR is found whose rule "matches" the target,\
the client MUST NOT consider any NAPTRs with a higher value for order.\
<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<br>\
$ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.5.5.5.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa.<br>\
IN NAPTR 100 10 "U" "E2U+sip" "!^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com!i" .<br>\
IN NAPTR 102 10 "U" "E2U+email" "!^.*$!mailto:information@example.com!i" .<br>\
<br>\
<br>\
The first record has an order value of 100, which is lower than 102, so it is\
picked first.\
\

295	Preference	1	1	1268299886	1	1268301600	An integer that specifies the order in which NAPTR records with equal "order"\
values SHOULD be processed, low numbers being processed before high numbers. \
This is similar to the preference field in an MX record, and is used so domain\
administrators can direct clients towards more capable hosts or  lighter weight\
protocols.  A client MAY look at records with higher preference values if it has\
a good reason to do so such as not understanding the preferred protocol or\
service.<br>\
<br>\
The important difference between Order and Preference is that once a match is\
found the client MUST NOT consider records with a different Order but they MAY\
process records with the same Order but different Preferences.  I.e., Preference\
is used to give weight to rules that are considered the same from an authority\
standpoint but not from a simple load balancing standpoint.\
\

296	Flags ENUM	1	1	1268301768	1	1268654292	Flags:<br>\
<br>\
A character string containing flags to control aspects of the rewriting and\
interpretation of the fields in the record.  Flags are single characters from\
the set [A-Z0-9].  The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant. <br>\
 At this time only four flags, "S", "A", "U", and "P", are defined.  The "S",\
"A" and "U" flags denote a terminal lookup. This means that this NAPTR record is\
the last one and that the flag determines what the next stage should be.  The\
"S" flag means that the next lookup should be for SRV records.  "A" means that\
the next lookup should be for either an A, AAAA, or A6 record.  The "U" flag\
means that the next step is not a DNS lookup but that the output of the Regexp\
field is an URI that adheres to the 'absoluteURI' production found in the ABNF\
of RFC 2396. <br>\
\

297	Regex ( optional SRV)	1	1	1268307314	1	1270760713	Regex:<br>\
A STRING containing a substitution expression that is applied to the original\
string held by the client in order to construct the next domain name to lookup.<br>\
<br>\
Optional SRV:<br>\
The next NAME to query for NAPTR, SRV, or address records depending on the value\
of the flags field.  This MUST be a fully qualified domain-name. \

301	cOptions	1	1	1268687547	1	1268688629	Overview\
\
You can place optional standard BIND configuration lines that will appear in the\
/usr/local/idns/named.d/master.zones file (included via\
/usr/local/idns/named.conf) or special unxsBind options listed below:\
\
unxsBind Options\
\
//NoNonRRNS\
\
This directs unxsBind to not include the zones tZone set tNSSet list of NS\
resource records. This option may be useful if you want to publish a zone to a\
set of NSs, but with only tResource provided NS RRs.\
\
//DotSignedExtension\
\
This directs unxsBind to use the zone name with a .signed extension. This is\
used internally for testing initial DNSSEC support.\
\
TSIG Notes\
\
If a tConfiguration cTSIGKeyName global TSIG key name value exists. It is placed\
in the master.zones zone section like so for EVERY ZONE:\
\
allow-transfer { key cTSIGKeyName;};\
allow-update { key cTSIGKeyName;};\
\
If you only want some zones to have these BIND statements (or every zone to use\
a different key name. You can set that directly in cOptions for each zone.
