2	Serial Number	1	1	1173480218	0	0	The serial number format is YYYYMMDDNN, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month,\
DD is the day, and NN is a count of how many times the zone data was modified\
that day. <br>These fields won't work in any other order, since no other order\
gives a value that always increases as the date changes. <br>This is critical:\
whatever format you choose, it's important that the serial number always\
increase when you update your zone data.
3	Expire TTL	1	1	1173480447	0	0	Used by other DNS servers that are configured to load and host the zone to\
determine when zone data expires if it is not renewed.\

4	Refresh TTL	1	1	1173480497	0	0	Used to determine how often other DNS servers that load and host the zone must\
attempt to renew the zone.
5	Retry TTL	1	1	1173480526	0	0	Used to determine how often other DNS servers that load and host the zone are to\
retry a request for update of the zone each time that the refresh interval occurs.
6	Default TTL	1	1	1173480628	0	0	This TTL will be used as default for all the Resource Records that do not have\
an explicit TTL set (i.e TTL = 0)\

7	Negative TTL	1	1	1173480838	0	0	 Negative caching TTL Negative answers (such as when a requested record does not\
exist) can be cached on non-authoritative servers as well. This field acts like\
the overall TTL but specifically for negative answers. Small values are\
appropriate (15m to 2h). 
8	Hostmaster	1	1	1173481017	0	0	Email address of the person responsible for the zone. Please note that the '@'\
symbol has to be changed by a '.'.<br>\
<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<br>\
joe@someisp.net<br>\
<br>\
turns into:<br>\
<br>\
joe.someisp.net\

9	Resource TTL	1	1	1173482563	1	1175623776	The time the Resource Record will be cached in seconds. If left blank, (0) it\
will use the default TTL for the Zone.\

meaning:<br>\
<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<br>\
In a 'A' type RR, Resource Name indicates the host:<br>\
<br>\
www IN A 217.32.45.123<br>\
<br>\
Resource Name: www<br>\
RR Type: A<br>\
IP Address: 217.32.45.123<br>\
<br>\
Please note that is also possible to leave Resource Name blank for A records, in\
that case it takes the value of the $ORIGIN (The zone name)
11	Resource Type	1	1	1175625855	1	1175626050	Indicates the type of the RR.<br>\
RR type may be one of the following:<br>\
<br>\
<strong>A:</strong> maps a hostname to a 32-bit IPv4 address.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<br>\
www A 217.136.12.45<br>\
<br>\
<strong>MX:</strong> is a type of resource record specifying how Internet e-mail\
should be routed. MX records point to the servers that should receive an e-mail,\
and their priority relative to each other.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<br>\
mydomain.com MX 10 mailserver.mydomain.com.<br>\
<br>\
<strong>HINFO:</strong> Host Information (HINFO) record can be set up to give\
hardware operating system (OS) information about each host. Its presence is\
optional, but having the information available can be useful.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
<br>\
myserver HINFO   "Pentium III" "Linux"<br>\
<br>\
<strong>CNAME:</strong> this record type is used to define an alias host name.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
www CNAME mydomain.com.<br>\
<br>\
<strong>TXT:</strong>this record type allows you to associate any arbitrary text\
with a host name. This may be used to define Domain Keys or SPF records.<br>\
E.g.:<br>\
mydomain.com TXT  "v=spf1 ptr ~all"<br>\
<br>\
<strong>PTR:</strong> this resource type is only used when a reverse\
(in-addr.arpa) zone is selected. This record map a IPv4 address to a domain\
name.<br>\
E.g:<br>\
<br>\
Zone is in-addr.arpa.35.22.217<br>\

#
51	uTTL	1	1	1208792866	1	1208793186	The $TTL directive is defined in RFC 2308.\
\
TTL in the DNS context defines the duration in seconds that the record may be\
cached. Zero indicates the record should not be cached. Note: RFC 1912 cautions\
that 0 = no caching is not widely implemented so make no assumptions.\
\
The default TTL for the zone is defined in BIND9 by the $TTL directive which\
must appear at the beginning of the zone file i.e. before any RR to which it\
will apply. This $TTL is used for any Resource Record which does not explicitly\
set the 'ttl' field.\
\
The TTL field is defined to be an unsigned 32 bit value with a valid range from\
0 to 2147483647 (clarified in RFC 2181) - which is a long time! - somewhere on\
the other side of 68 years.\
\
The $TTL field may take any time value.\
\
In BIND 8 the SOA record (minimum parameter) was used to define the zone default\
TTL value. In BIND 9 the SOA 'minimum' parameter is used as the negative\
(NXDOMAIN) caching time (defined in RFC 2308). See our tZone.uZoneTTL\
\
RFC 1912 recommends that the $TTL value be set to 1 day or longer and that\
certain RRs which rarely change, such as the MX records for the domain, use an\
explicit TTL value to set even longer values such as 2 to 3 weeks. The value of\
this field is a balance between how frequently you think the DNS records will\
change vs load on the DNS server. In the example below the $TTL value of 2d (2\
days) indicates that any change may not be fully propagated for 48 hours,\
equally caching DNS servers will require to re-read the RRs from your DNS every\
48 hours which can be a non-trivial load. Many users will set this value to say\
2w (2 weeks) in normal operation then prior to planned changes will reduce the\
value to say 1d or 12h, until the change has stabilized then restore the value\
to 2w.
52	uZoneTTL	1	1	1208793324	0	0	uZoneTTL is the last TTL SOA value, the minumum parameter as explained below:\
\
In BIND 9 the SOA 'minimum' parameter is used as the negative\
(NXDOMAIN) caching time (defined in RFC 2308).\
\
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse with uTTL which is the $TTL directive value. See uTTL.
53	uZone	1	1	1208795481	0	0	uZone is the internal SQL database unsigned integer key assigned to a single\
tZone record.
54	cZone	1	1	1208795597	1	1208796021	cZone is the name of a fully qualified DNS zone (with no trailing dot.) There\
can be multiple tZone records with the same cZone as long as they are for\
different views (see tView.)\
\
IMPORTANT\
\
You have to be careful to understand the node/level hierarchy in DNS so that if\
you have in your DNS configuration, for example, two zone files where one is\
included in the other the most specific will in most cases overwrite the\
resource record  and SOA data of the less specific.\
\
An example: \
\
biginternet.com and www.biginternet.com are both setup in your DNS system\
(arguably not a best practice!) Then even if an A record for www exists in the\
biginternet.com zone. It would not be served. The A record if it exists in\
www.biginternet.com would be served, and if the A record does not exist in\
www.biginternet.com then a nxdomain would be served. In general the less\
specific zone will be ignored if a more specific match exists. \
\
These cases cause great confusion among new DNS administrators.\
\

55	uNameServer	1	1	1208797747	0	0	uNameServer is the unsigned integer key into tNameServer.\
\
The table tNameServer is where sets of name servers (NSs) are configured.\
\
From the tZone tab you can assign or change any pre-configured name server set\
(NS set)  for a given tZone. \
\
Please note the possible problems that may arise if you assign different NS sets\
to same tZone.cZone but with different views.\
\
In general a seconday only zone will have a special NS set created, and have an\
external  master configured. This is a master DNS server setup to transfer to\
the herein slave servers authoratative data according to the SOA TTLs.
56	cHostmaster	1	1	1208797992	0	0	cHostmaster is the email for person (or a role) responsible for this zone. \
\
It does NOT USE NORMAL EMAIL NOTATION. But uses the DNS . (dot) instead of the @\
symbol. This means that the email can not have a dot before the email domain.\
For example john.smith@biginternet.com would become in DNS parlance:\
john@smith.biginternet.com.
57	uSerial	1	1	1208798119	0	0	uSerial is an unsigned 32 bit value in range 1 to 4294967295 with a maximum\
increment of 2147483647. In BIND implementations this is defined to be a 10\
digit field. \
\
This value MUST change when any resource record in the zone file is updated. The\
convention is to use a date based value to simplify this task - the most popular\
being yyyymmddss where yyyy = year, mm = month and dd = day ss = a sequence\
number in case you update it more than once in the day! Using this date format\
means that the value 2005021002 means the last update was on the 10th Febrary\
2005 and it was the third update that day. \
\
The date format is just a convention not a requirement so BIND will provide no\
validation of the field. It is easy to make mistakes and get serial numbers out\
of sequence. That is why mysqlBind2 takes care of this for you.
58	uExpire	1	1	1208798255	0	0	uExpire is a signed 32 bit value in seconds. It indicates when the zone data is\
no longer authoritative. This applies to slaves or secondary servers only.\
Slaves stop responding to queries for the zone when this time has expired and no\
contact has been made with the master. \
\
Thus when the ref values expires the slave will attempt to read the SOA record\
for the zone - and request a zone transfer AXFR/IXFR if the sn has changed. If\
contact is made the expiry and refresh values are reset and tyhe cycle starts\
again. \
\
If the slave fails to contact the master it will retry every retry period but\
continue to supply authoritative data for the zone until the expiry value is\
reached at which point it will stop answering queries for the domain. RFC 1912\
recommends 1209600 to 2419200 seconds (2-4 weeks) to allow for major outages of\
the master.
59	uRefresh	1	1	1208798378	0	0	uRefresh is an usigned 32 bit time value in seconds (in mysqlBind.) \
\
It indicates the time when the slave will try to refresh the zone from the master. \
\
RFC 1912 recommends 1200 to 43200 seconds, low (1200) if the data is volatile or\
43200 (12 hours) if it's not. Since mysqlBind clusters are using NOTIFY you can\
set for much higher values e.g. 1 or more days > 86400.
60	uRetry	1	1	1208798568	0	0	uRetry is an unsigned 32 bit value in seconds. \
\
It defines the time between retries if the slave (secondary) fails to contact\
the master when uRefresh has expired. \
\
Typical values would be 180 (3 minutes) to 900 (15 minutes) or higher.

This tab allows you to create zones using a list and to add RRs to any zone you\
want.<br>\
<br>\
<strong>Usage:</strong><br>\
\
For importing zone resource records:\
\
At the Bulk Data Entry Panel you must enter the zone name on a line using:<br>\
<div align=center>cZone=thezonename.com;</div><br>\
<br>\
By the default, if the zone specified at the cZone parameter is invalid, the\
data is ignored and the importer keeps going until de next cZone definition. If\
you want the system to automatically create non existent zones, you have to\
define the uCreateZones parameter as follows:<br>\
<div align=center>uCreateZones;</div><br>\
Once the zone is defined you can enter the resource(s) record(s) you want to\
import.<br>\
The format of this input is:<br>\
RRName RRType RRParam1 [RRParam2]<br>\
<br>\
RRName is the Name of the Resource Record, use '@' for $ORIGIN.<br>\
RRType is the Resource Record Type. It may be one of the following:<br><br>\
<strong>A</strong> RRParam1 required. E.g: host A 216.32.45.78<br>\
