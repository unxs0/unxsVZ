To run this test suite, you have to:

 1- Create an empty zone named unixservicetest.com, owned by the default 'DNS ASP' company.
 2- Mae sure the John Doe/wsxedc test contact exists.

If you want to use it with a different zone/contact, edit the ZonesTab file in this directory.

For loading the test suite, open the idnsOrgSuite.xml file in Selenium IDE.
