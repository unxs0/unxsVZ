idnsOrg Quick Install Instructions

Prerequisites:

You must have your iDNS backend system installed (iDNS.cgi) and tested.


Instructions:

1-. Set your CGIDIR environment variable (if not set) to the directory where you wish to install the 
	idnsOrg.cgi binary and also where you have the iDNS.cgi already installed. 

	Example:

	# export CGIDIR=/var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/

2-. Compile and install with a single command the binary file. Run the following command in this
	directory:

	# make install
	
3-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp)
    Then install the CSS stylesheet file and the interface templates.

	Example for installing the CSS stylesheet:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/css/styles.css  /var/www/unxs/html/css
	# cp -i ./templates/css/popups.js  /var/www/unxs/html/css

	For installing the system templates:

	# ./importTemplates.sh

4-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp) 
    Finally you have to install the interface images.

	Example:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.gif /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.jpg /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.png /var/www/unxs/html/images

5-. Then login and test your new idnsOrg interface, via your Firefox browser.
