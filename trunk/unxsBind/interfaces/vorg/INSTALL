vdnsOrg Quick Install Instructions

Brief Introduction:

vdnsOrg provides the same functionality as idnsOrg. The only difference they have (at least on the
end user point of view) is that vdnsOrg can handle zones deployed for all the BIND views
deployed in the system. On the other hand, vdnsOrg only allows editing the resource records
of zones in the external view.

Prerequisites:

You must have your iDNS backend system installed (iDNS.cgi) and tested.

Important:

If you install vdnsOrg you ****won't be able to use idnsOrg*** since the templates used by both 
applications are mutually exclusive.


Instructions:

1-. Set your CGIDIR environment variable (if not set) to the directory where you wish to install the 
	idnsOrg.cgi binary and also where you have the iDNS.cgi already installed. 

	Example:

	# export CGIDIR=/var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/

2-. Compile and install with a single command the binary file. Run the following command in this
	directory:

	# make install
	
3-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp)
    Then install the CSS stylesheet file and the interface templates.

	Example for installing the CSS stylesheet:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/css/styles.css  /var/www/unxs/html/css
	# cp -i ./templates/css/popups.js  /var/www/unxs/html/css

	For installing the system templates:

	# ./importTemplates.sh

4-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp) 
    Finally you have to install the interface images.

	Example:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.gif /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.jpg /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.png /var/www/unxs/html/images

5-. Then login and test your new vdnsOrg interface, via your Firefox browser.

	Example browser location URL:
