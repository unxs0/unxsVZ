vdnsOrg Quick Install Instructions

---
Brief Introduction:

vdnsOrg provides the same functionality as idnsOrg. The only difference they have (at least on the
end user point of view) is that vdnsOrg can handle zones deployed for all the BIND views
deployed in the system. On the other hand, vdnsOrg only allows editing the resource records
of zones in the external view.

---
Prerequisites:

You must have your iDNS backend system installed (iDNS.cgi) and tested.

---
Important notes about upgrading and other post install issues:

1-. If you install vdnsOrg ****you won't be able to use idnsOrg***, since the templates used by both 
applications are mutually exclusive.  (See 2-. below for more confusion on template issue.)

2-. You need to restore with the backend tTemplate (for some unknown reason that we are trying to figure out.)

Assuming unxsBind/data is located /home/someuser/unxsBind/data and that MySQL is setup to allow
root access from the server you have your source on. Then...

# ln -s /home/someuser/unxsBind /home/someuser/iDNS
# export ISMROOT=/home/someuser
# /var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/iDNS.cgi Restore tTemplate MySQLRootPasswd


3-. New LDAP debug log issues, so you need to first create it with some valid perms.

# touch /var/log/unxsBindLDAP.log
# chown apache:root /var/log/unxsBindLDAP.log
# chmod 240 /var/log/unxsBindLDAP.log

You must also set new local.h.default LDAP section defines in your ../../local.h


---
Instructions:

1-. Compile and install with a single command the binary file. Run the following command in this
	directory:

	# make install
	
2-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp)
    Then install the CSS stylesheet file and the interface templates.

	Example for installing the CSS stylesheet:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/css/styles.css  /var/www/unxs/html/css
	# cp -i ./templates/css/popups.js  /var/www/unxs/html/css

	For installing the system templates:

	# ./importTemplates.sh

3-. (If you already installed idnsAdmin skip this setp) 
    Finally you have to install the interface images.

	Example:

	# cd ../admin
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.gif /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.jpg /var/www/unxs/html/images
	# cp -i ./templates/images/*.png /var/www/unxs/html/images

4-. Then login and test your new vdnsOrg interface, via your Firefox browser.

	Example browser location URL:

	https://192.168.22.128:9333/cgi-bin/vdnsOrg.cgi
