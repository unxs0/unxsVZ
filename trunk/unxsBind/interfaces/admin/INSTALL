idnsAdmin Quick Install Instructions

Prerequisites:

You must have your iDNS system installed. Minimally the backend interface (iDNS.cgi) and the database setup.

Instructions:

1. Set your CGIDIR environment variable (if not set) to the directory where you wish to install the idnsAdmin.cgi binary. E.g.:

	# export CGIDIR=/cgi-bin/

2. Compile and install with a single command the binary file. Run the following command at this directory:

	# make install
	
3. Then you have to install the CSS stylesheet file and the interface templates.
For installing the CSS stylesheet:

	# cp ./templates/styles.css <your web server root folder> (E.g.: /var/www/htdocs/)

For installing the system templates:

	# ./importTemplates.sh

4. Lastly, the final fancy touch, you have to install the interface images. For doing so you have to run:

	# cp -R ./templates/images <your web server root folder> (E.g.: /var/www/htdocs/)

Then login and enjoy your idnsAdmin interface :)
