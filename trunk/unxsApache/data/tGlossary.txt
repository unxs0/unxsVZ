1	tSite	1	1	1183471641	1	1183582441	cDomain is the website FQDN (with no www usually.) Most hosting for non SSL (or\
non future SSL -ecommerce sites) is done with name based sites (sites that share\
an IP, usually of a root IP based site -the webfarm or reseller master site.)\
uStatus and uSite are set by the system on creation. uServer should be set to\
the default (or for a cluster web farm system you may want to assign this site\
to one of many master webfarm servers.) cParkedDomains is a list (one per line)\
of FQDNs (each line preceeded by mandatory ServerAlias) that also have DNS A or\
CNAME records pointing to a name based site (IP based sites do not need this\
text area set.) cIP is the unique IP number allocated for non name based sites\
OR the shared IP number of the sites root IP based site (this is taken care for\
you in Step 2.) Depending on the type of site you will be able to select from a\
list of configuration templates during Step 2. These will configure your new\
site for you providing the cVirtualHost (and maybe the cSSLVirtualHost)\
sections. The other options should only be changed by experienced users.\

cParkedDomains Example:\
\
ServerAlias www.acme.com\
