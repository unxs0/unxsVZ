This directory contains code for the collection of diverse VZ operating parameters and other 
hardware node system vars.

The included public domain bash program is being tested with the du command in ubc.c since
in some large mail store containers (on older slow hardware) it takes too long. 
Also investigating alternatives to system(), that may allow timeout control like execl() 
and fork().
