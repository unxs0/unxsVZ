1	Autonomics	1	1	1247282803	1	1247283686	Autonomics refers to programmatic defined changes to container user bean\
counters (UBCs) or to the replication or migration of containers.\
\
<p>\
In a datacenter, node or container property list it maybe specified with values\
of <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>. If not specified then autonomics functions should\
not apply.\

11	Autonomics-Type	1	1	1247283629	1	1247283699	Autonomics-Type refers to the unxsVZ type of programmatic defined changes to\
container user bean counters (UBCs) or to the replication or migration of\
containers.\
\
<p>\
In a datacenter, node or container property list it maybe specified with values\
of:\
<p>\
<i>Optimize</i><br>\
<i>MoveLocal</i><br>\
<i>MoveGlobal</i><br>\
<i>ElasticLocal</i><br>\
<i>ElasticGlobal</i><br>\
\
<p>\
<i>Optimize</i> refers to in place container UBC modification<br>\
<i>MoveLocal</i> refers to the automated moving of a container to another node\
in the same datacenter.<br>\
<i>MoveGlobal</i> same as MoveLocal but may include other datacenter nodes.<br>\
<i>ElasticLocal</i> refers to the automated expansion and shrinking of the\
number of functional group containers on nodes in same datacenter.<br>\
<i>ElasticGlobal</i> same as ElasticLocal but across datacenters<br>\
\
<p>\
Other property parameters will define how the autonomic type will be further\
defined for use by the autonomic action program.\

12	cIPv4	1	1	1247285045	0	0	cIPv4 is a 4 octet IP number in string format.\
\
<p>\
Usually used in a node property table to specify the main public IP used by the\
hardware node (ex. eth0). Other IPs may exist and they are specified by\
cIPv4-eth1 for example. Usually hardware nodes have at least 2 IPs a datacenter\
private IP for inter-node high speed communication and another public IP for\
container connectivity of public services.\
\
<p>\
Node containers may have datacenter or node private IPs and therefore the node\
may provide DNAT/SNAT for the given container service. The iptables rules that\
provide for this are usually migratable via /etc/vz/conf/ mount/umount scripts.\

21	WarningEmail	1	1	1247544704	1	1248441294	Used by autonomics subsystem to warn by set email of approaching limitations and\
other\
error or warning conditions that may be configured or use system defaults.\
\
<p>\
Accepted values: Single email or comma delimited list of email addresses.<br>\
Ex. supportgrp@unixservice.com,joe@hosting.co.uk\
\
<p>\
Scope: Can be set at the Datacenter, node or container level. \
\

31	Autonomics-PrivPagesActRatio	1	1	1248440829	1	1248441133	Autonomics-PrivPagesActRatio refers to a ratio (a percent ratio but the\
tProperty value is only set as an integer from 0 to 100 with no % sign) that is\
used by the autonomics agent daemon.\
<p>\
Values: Integer from 0 to 100.\
<p>\
Context: Only used for nodes.\
<p>\
Other: The action taken will depend on the Autonomics-Type for the node. For\
example, if the type is <i>Move</i> then the largest privvmpages using container\
on that node will be migrated live to another hardware node that is below the\
warning level and setup to receive such containers.\

WarningEmail.
41	Autonomics-PrivPagesWarnRatio	1	1	1248441050	1	1248441098	Autonomics-PrivPagesWarnRatio refers to a ratio (a percent ratio but the\
tProperty value is only set as an integer from 0 to 100 with no % sign) that is\
used by the autonomics agent daemon.\
<p>\
Values: Integer from 0 to 100.\
<p>\
Context: Only used for nodes.\
<p>\
Other: The action taken will depend on the Autonomics-Type for the node and if\
the warning emails have been set. Usually when this warning ratio threshold is\
exceeded a warning email will be sent to both the node and the container warn\
email addresses.\
\
<p>\
Related terms: Autonomics, Autonomics-Type, Autonomics-PrivPagesActRatio and \
WarningEmail
51	cCryptMethod	1	1	1254436501	0	0	cCryptMethod refers to the method used to store the encrypted tAuthorize.cPasswd.\
\
<p>\
The values can be DES or MD5. MD5 should be used since it has a much stronger\
salt. The stronger salt protects against automated dictionary attacks of\
compromised login cookies. \
\
<p>\
This password is used by the unxsVZ backend and other interfaces as part of the\
login credentials. It is stored on the client browser as a cookie but also\
encrypted with a strong salt. Since web interfaces should be be SSL only this\
provides a relatively secure cgi login control scheme. The obvious attacks are\
O(n) dictionary based, running all possible salt values. This is of course very\
slow for the large MD5 salts.\

61	cSnapshotDir	1	1	1254436834	0	0	cSnapshotDir is used on LVM2 enabled systems. It sepecifies a partition\
different from the /vz LVM partition.\
\
<p>\
It is used by vzdump related job queue processing (see jobqueue.c) At this time\
cloning and OS template creation jobs.\

91	Container-Type	1	1	1259359016	1	1259359054	Container-Type is usually a hardware node exclusive restriction for the hosting\
of VENET device based containers or bridged layer-2 VETH device based\
containers. Currently hardware nodes are exclusively VENET or VETH. In the vast\
majority of the cases VENET containers should be preferred.\
\
<p>\
Acceptable values are:<br>\
VENET Only\
VETH Only\
\
<p>\
Related terms: VETH VENET uVeth
81	cuSyncPeriod	1	1	1254575155	1	1254696207	cuSyncPeriod is the period in seconds for keeping cloned containers in sync with\
their source container counterpart.\
\
<p>\
This value is used by the job queue for automated clone sync operations.\
