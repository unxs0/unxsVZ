12	cIPv4	1	1	1247285045	0	0	cIPv4 is a 4 octet IP number in string format.\
\
<p>\
Usually used in a node property table to specify the main public IP used by the\
hardware node (ex. eth0). Other IPs may exist and they are specified by\
cIPv4-eth1 for example. Usually hardware nodes have at least 2 IPs a datacenter\
private IP for inter-node high speed communication and another public IP for\
container connectivity of public services.\
\
<p>\
Node containers may have datacenter or node private IPs and therefore the node\
may provide DNAT/SNAT for the given container service. The iptables rules that\
provide for this are usually migratable via /etc/vz/conf/ mount/umount scripts.\

21	WarningEmail	1	1	1247544704	1	1248441294	Used by autonomics subsystem to warn by set email of approaching limitations and\
other\
error or warning conditions that may be configured or use system defaults.\
\
<p>\
Accepted values: Single email or comma delimited list of email addresses.<br>\
Ex. supportgrp@unixservice.com,joe@hosting.co.uk\
\
<p>\
Scope: Can be set at the Datacenter, node or container level. \

Related terms: Autonomics-PrivPagesWarnRatio and similar.
31	Autonomics-PrivPagesActRatio	1	1	1248440829	1	1248441133	Autonomics-PrivPagesActRatio refers to a ratio (a percent ratio but the\
tProperty value is only set as an integer from 0 to 100 with no % sign) that is\
used by the autonomics agent daemon.\
<p>\
Values: Integer from 0 to 100.\
<p>\
Context: Only used for nodes.\
<p>\
Other: The action taken will depend on the Autonomics-Type for the node. For\
example, if the type is <i>Move</i> then the largest privvmpages using container\
on that node will be migrated live to another hardware node that is below the\
warning level and setup to receive such containers.\

41	Autonomics-PrivPagesWarnRatio	1	1	1248441050	1	1248441098	Autonomics-PrivPagesWarnRatio refers to a ratio (a percent ratio but the\
tProperty value is only set as an integer from 0 to 100 with no % sign) that is\
used by the autonomics agent daemon.\
<p>\
Values: Integer from 0 to 100.\
<p>\
Context: Only used for nodes.\
<p>\
Other: The action taken will depend on the Autonomics-Type for the node and if\
the warning emails have been set. Usually when this warning ratio threshold is\
exceeded a warning email will be sent to both the node and the container warn\
email addresses.\

51	cCryptMethod	1	1	1254436501	0	0	cCryptMethod refers to the method used to store the encrypted tAuthorize.cPasswd.\
\
<p>\
The values can be DES or MD5. MD5 should be used since it has a much stronger\
salt. The stronger salt protects against automated dictionary attacks of\
compromised login cookies. \
\
<p>\
This password is used by the unxsVZ backend and other interfaces as part of the\
login credentials. It is stored on the client browser as a cookie but also\
encrypted with a strong salt. Since web interfaces should be be SSL only this\
provides a relatively secure cgi login control scheme. The obvious attacks are\
O(n) dictionary based, running all possible salt values. This is of course very\
slow for the large MD5 salts.\

The node graph is a graph of all that node's container traffic collected via the\
venet\
interface data in /proc/net/dev/ special file.<br>\
The datacenter graph is an aggregation of all the traffic of all the\
datacenter's nodes.
531	uNode	1	1	1269265737	0	0	Unique hardware node ID number.
541	uContainer	1	1	1269271476	0	0	Unique container ID number that matches the underlying infrastructure OpenVZ\
VEID number.

IP. The OpenVZ hostname. If DNS is not being used then a cHostname like\

<p>\
Related terms: cLabel, uContainer.
561	uVeth	1	1	1269273858	1	1269273902	Hardware nodes can be venet or veth based. All containers in a given hardware\
node must be one or the either. uVeth=0 means that the container is a standard\
venet container.\
\
<p>\
The use of veth based containers is an advanced OpenVZ feature and is not\
recommended at this time for use with unxsVZ.\
\
<p>\
Virtual Ethernet device is an Ethernet-like device which can be used inside a\
container. Unlike venet network device, veth device has a MAC address, therefore\
it can be used in configurations, when veth is bridged to ethX or other device\
and container's user fully sets up his networking himself, including IPs,\
gateways etc.\
\
<p>\
Virtual Ethernet device consist of two Ethernet devices -- the one in CT0 and\
another one in CT. These devices are connected to each other, so if a packet\
goes to one device it will come out from the other device. 
571	uIPv4	1	1	1269274040	0	0	An index into tIP showing tIP.cLabel. A standard IP version 4 number, four\

template file that resides on the hardware node in the  /vz/template/cache\
directory. The actual file has the .tar.gz. suffix added to the\
tOSTemplate.cLabel. Some unxsVZ operations require the existence of md5sum check\
sum files in md5sum -c format.\
\
<p>\
E.g. centos-5-x86-minimal would refer to the\
/vz/template/cache/centos-5-x86-minimal.tar.gz and\
/vz/template/cache/centos-5-x86-minimal.tar.gz.md5sum files.\

template file that resides on the hardware node in the  /etc/vz/conf\
directory. The actual file has a .conf-sample suffix and a ve- prefix added to\
the tConfig.cLabel. After container creation the config template is the basis\
for the per container /etc/vz/conf/VIED.conf file.\
\
<p>\
E.g. freepbx26_v2 would refer to the /etc/vz/conf/ve-freepbx26_v2.conf-sample file.\
