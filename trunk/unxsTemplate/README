1-. How to install this LGPL library:

	If you have the mysql-devel pkg installed then

	server1> make install 

	should be enough.

2-. How to use it in your programs:

	Place an include in your program file or header file where needed

	#include <openisp/template.h>

	Link to this small static library, for example:

	server1> cc example.o -o example /usr/lib/openisp/template.a

	and correctly initialized (connected to MySQL server etc.):

	MYSQL gMysql;

	And finall you must provide at least a stub version of this function:

	void AppFunctions(FILE *fp,char *cFunction);
