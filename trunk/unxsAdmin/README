This unxsVZ dir will host the unxsadmin rpm that will be required for all
other unxsVZ admin web interfaces. It will provide the shared 
html/css/images/js required by any unxsX web interface.

The intial idea is to leverage the CentOS 5 httpd/apache2 setup via a:

/etc/httpd/conf.d/unxs.conf 

That will provide an SSL only location to /var/www/unxs on a random
high number port.

The proposed base structure of the /var/www/unxs dir will be:

/var/www/unxs/cgi-bin
/var/www/unxs/logs
/var/www/unxs/html
/var/www/unxs/html/images
/var/www/unxs/html/js
/var/www/unxs/html/css

Other packages will be able to add additional content. For example, unxsBind 
would add at least:

/var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/iDNS.cgi
/var/www/unxs/cgi-bin/idnsAdmin.cgi
