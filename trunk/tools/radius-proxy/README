/etc/rc.local is used for S99local server boot
/usr/sbin/start-mysqlproxy.sh is used by the nanny.pl and the rc.local
/usr/sbin/mysqlproxy-nanny.pl is the perl daemon that if the proxy dies
	(no pid) it restarts it. In the future it could also be improved to 
	actually check functionality of proxy and if not working kill it and
	restart anew.

The start-mysqlproxy.sh have to be customized for container IP and the set of
MySQL servers they front for.
