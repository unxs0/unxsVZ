The VEID.mount and VEID.umount files in this dir are only simple examples to be 
used as basis for tTemplate.cTemplate entries.

The way unxsVZ implements the mount/umount system can easily be extended to a
VEID.start/VEID.stop system.

Further, one can envision that the OpenVZ start/stop script system could be used
for a one time only on container creation for configuration of an "appliance" 
container that could then come up configured and ready for use
based on tProperty configuration entries. For the one time only system to work
the start script would have to be deleted by the same script after configuration
success. The stop script would not be used in this case.
