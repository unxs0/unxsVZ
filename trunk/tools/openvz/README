NOTES

vzdump requires cstream and an MTA. You can get cstream via yum from the rpmforge
repo. If you have sendmail installed you will have to do an:

rpm -nodeps -i <the vzdump rpm> install. 

This is due to an error in the sendmail packaging not marking it as supplying
an MTA, on the other hand exim does inform that it supplies an MTA.
