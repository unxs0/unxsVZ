Intro
-----

These scripts need to be customized for each datacenter/unxsVZ implementation.
Usually the changes refer to hardware node issues and httpd content serving.

unxsVZ.tConfiguration Setup
---------------------------

In order to view the graphs in the unxsVZ backend you must setup certain
tConfiguration name value pairs. Here is the list

unxsVZ.tConfiguration.cLabel:unxsVZ.tConfiguration.cValue
---------------------------------------------------------

cTrafficDirURL:/traffic
cNodeTrafficDirURL:/traffic
cDatacenterTrafficDirURL:/traffic/MarketStreet.png

Installation
------------

We usually install these scripts chmod 500 in /usr/local/sbin/

Hardware node root (or /etc/cron) crontab example section
---------------------------------------------------------

*/5 * * * * sleep 30; nice /usr/local/sbin/vz_traffic_log.sh >> /var/log/unxsVZ.ProcessJobQueue.log 2>&1;
*/5 * * * * sleep 40; nice /usr/local/sbin/node_traffic_log.sh  >> /var/log/unxsVZ.ProcessJobQueue.log 2>&1;
*/5 * * * * sleep 50; nice /usr/local/sbin/datacenter_traffic_log.sh  >> /var/log/unxsVZ.ProcessJobQueue.log 2>&1;


Final Notes
-----------

Only the cDatacenterTrafficDirURL entry specifies an actual image file. It also is the only
script that can run on a single hardware node. The filename must match the one used in the
datacenter_traffic_log.sh script. Of course the rrd can and probably should be
copied to all nodes along with the current graph. For faster hardware node failure segmentation
recovery. Following our basic idea of allowing for any hardware node to be a unxsVZ controller,
and that if any hardware node is down the rest still work together fine.

The other two refer to dirs. These dirs must exist in the context of the unxsVZ URL.
