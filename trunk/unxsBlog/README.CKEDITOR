Since unxsBlog latest version, we have replaced the tContent tab cText textarea for a WYSIWYG editor. Our choice was CKEDITOR (Not shipped with the unxsBlog sources.)
To install it, do:

# wget http://download.cksource.com/CKEditor/CKEditor/CKEditor%203.0.1/ckeditor_3.0.1.tar.gz

(Note that version may vary!)

Uncompress the .tar.gz:

# tar zxf ckeditor_3.0.1.tar.gz

And then copy the contest of it to the /var/www/unxs/html/js folder

# cp -R ckeditor/* /var/www/unxs/html/js

And voila!
