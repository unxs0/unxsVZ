1	tUser Tab	1	1	1186495150	0	0	The user table (tUser) is mostly used for mail end user linux accounts. These\
are the actual pop, imap or webmail capable accounts. In other words they are\
related to system accounts that receive email. Note that the real-world email\
address, for example, joe@someco.com is not related to the pop login, or to the\
tUser.cLogin for downloading mail for that email address.
