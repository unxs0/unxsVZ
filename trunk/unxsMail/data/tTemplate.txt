This template usually ends up as a .procmailrc in the users linux home dir on\
one or more mail cluster servers depending on uTemplateType\

Site with lots of examples and information about procmail:\

http://lipas.uwasa.fi/~ts/info/proctips.html	# SpamAssassin sample procmailrc\
# ==============================\
\
# The following line is only used if you use a system-wide /etc/procmailrc.\
# See procmailrc(5) for infos on what it exactly does, the short version:\
#  * It ensures that the correct user is passed to spamd if spamc is used\
#  * The folders the mail is filed to later on is owned by the user, not\
#    root.\
DROPPRIVS=yes\
\
# Pipe the mail through spamassassin (replace 'spamassassin' with 'spamc'\
# if you use the spamc/spamd combination)\
#\
# The condition line ensures that only messages smaller than 500 kB\
# (500 * 1024 = 512000 bytes) are processed by SpamAssassin. Most spam\
# isn't bigger than a few k and working with big messages can bring\
# SpamAssassin to its knees.\
#\
# The lock file ensures that only 1 spamassassin invocation happens\
# at 1 time, to keep the load down.\

# Mails with a score of 15 or higher are almost certainly spam (with 0.05%\

This template usually becomes a file in a user home dir, for example:\
\
/home/joe/.spamassassin/user_prefs	#\
# SpamAssassin user preferences file.  See 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'\
# for details of what can be tweaked.\

\
# How many points before a mail is considered spam.\
# required_score                5\
\
# Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so\
# "friend@somewhere.com", "*@isp.com", or "*.domain.net" will all work.\
# whitelist_from        someone@somewhere.com\
\
# Add your own customised scores for some tests below.  The default scores are\
# read from the installed spamassassin rules files, but you can override them\

# Speakers of Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese and Korean, will almost\
