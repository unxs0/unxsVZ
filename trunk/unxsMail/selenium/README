*** Short description about the test suites in this directory ***

unxsMail.tDomain/unxsMail-tDomain.xml
---------------------------------------
Tests tDomain and related (tLocal,tRelay and tVUT) new, mod and delete 
functionality.

unxsMail.tUser/unxsMail-tUser.xml
-----------------------------------
Test tUser new, mod and delete operations.
Please note that you can *not* run this test suite in a single run. You must
load it in your Selenium interface and execute the test cases one by one
using the 'Play current test case' button.

The reason for this is that the jobqueue processor must update tUser record
uStatus field upon creation.

If you are a developer, you probably would run the job queue processor at
your development sytem, so you may want to delete the second server from
the tServerGroupGlue table before starting to test.

unxsMail.tVUTEntries/unxsMail-tVUTEntries.xml
----------------------------------------------
Test tVUTEntries new, mod and delete functionality.
