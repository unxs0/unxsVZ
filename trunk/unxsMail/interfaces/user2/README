This folder contains a cgi interface for the unxsVZ unxsMail system.

mailUser.cgi

This interface is for end users to change their password and eventually
to allow them to edit more user specific settings like their white/black lists
and vacation messages.

Finally if the user forgot his password, and the system has been so configured
a new password can be created via an external email account and a correct 
question/answer response from tUser.

Since this interface is meant for end user use a standard port 443 httpd server
should be used and must have it's own html dir (with exec cgi perms) for the index.cgi
created by make install.
