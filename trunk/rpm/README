CentOS 5+ RPM Building Setup
----------------------------

To build rpm's make sure you have everythig you need installed:

# yum install rpm-build
# yum install redhat-rpm-config

And of course you will need everything to compile and make your binaries. Like 
gcc, make etc...

Using provided script
---------------------

To use our unxsBuildPkg.sh script you will need to create your rpm-staging dir one
level up from the unxsVZ dir.  You will also need to:

#  export UNXSVZ=/home/joe/unxsVZ 

for example

Notes
-----

We will use /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES so be careful. Make sure you cleanup correctly
so as not to add items to your RPM that you did not intend.

We will try to provide correct and as simple as possible .spec files for all unxsVZ
component software.
